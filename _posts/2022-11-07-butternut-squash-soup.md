Made this a couple weeks before at my friend's place and really loved how warm and soothing the soup was. 
I also wanted to try my hand at making homemade bread so I thought the two would go together pretty well. 
Really enjoyed this [recipe](https://www.isabeleats.com/roasted-butternut-squash-soup-with-toasted-pumpkin-seeds/) and another plus is that one butternut squash makes quite a bit of soup.
