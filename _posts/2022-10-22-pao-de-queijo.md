Went to Brazil in June with some friends and these were one of my favorite things I ate there! 
This was a first attempt to replace the frozen food aisle variety from Trader Joe's. 
Not the prettiest bread I have ever seen but I thought the [cheese bread](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-po-de-queijo-brazilian-cheese-bread-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-176118) ended up turning out pretty well!
