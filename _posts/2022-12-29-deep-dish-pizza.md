While making pie last week, I decided making a deep dish pizza was the natural next step. 
(Plus, the deep dish at Regents' Pizzeria is really something). 
When I found that Sally's Baking Addiction had a [recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-make-chicago-style-deep-dish-pizza/") that's really all I needed to get started.
It wasn't the prettiest pizza, but I think it tasted decent.
I may have also pushed the limits on how deep a pizza can really get.
