# How to Use This Template

## Installation

Install Jekyll (follow the instructions at <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Jekyll</a>). 

One small issue: When I installed Jekyll (2022/12/30) the documentation page said to run `ruby-install ruby`. I ran into some issues with ruby versioning since 3.2.0 was released (2022/12/25) while the Jekyll documentation expected Ruby version 3.1.x. To fix this, you can instead run `ruby-install ruby-3.1`. Someone reported the bug <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/9233">here</a> so this may have been fixed already.

## Building the Website

Once you have cloned the repository, run the following commands.

`bundle update`

`bundle exec jekyll serve`
