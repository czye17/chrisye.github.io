        <h2><a href="/cooking/2022/12/29/deep-dish-pizza.html">Deep Dish Pizza</a></h2>
        <p>While making pie last week, I decided making a deep dish pizza was the natural next step. 
(Plus, the deep dish at Regentsâ€™ Pizzeria is really something). 
When I found that Sallyâ€™s Baking Addiction had a <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-make-chicago-style-deep-dish-pizza/&quot;">recipe</a> thatâ€™s really all I needed to get started.
It wasnâ€™t the prettiest pizza, but I think it tasted decent.
I may have also pushed the limits on how deep a pizza can really get.</p>

        <p>Made a really tasty empanada (not picture) dinner and apple crumble pie (pictured) dessert for Christmas Eve dinner with Zac.
Followed this one up with a santa hat jog the next morning ðŸŽ„</p>

        <p>Had to make some ramen so I can show off the nice bowl I bought during Thanksgiving. 
As usual, the soft-boiled marinated eggs were the best part. ðŸ¥š</p>

An amazing thanksgiving dinner to start an awesome weekend ðŸ˜Š</p>

        <p>Thank you again to Alvaro for adding another great recipe to my list! 
I make this almost every week nowâ€¦</p>

        <h2><a href="/cooking/2022/11/07/butternut-squash-soup.html">Butternut Squash Soup</a></h2>
        <p>Made this a couple weeks before at my friendâ€™s place and really loved how warm and soothing the soup was. 
I also wanted to try my hand at making homemade bread so I thought the two would go together pretty well. 
Really enjoyed this <a href="https://www.isabeleats.com/roasted-butternut-squash-soup-with-toasted-pumpkin-seeds/">recipe</a> and another plus is that one butternut squash makes quite a bit of soup.</p>

        <h2><a href="/cooking/2022/10/22/pao-de-queijo.html">Pao De Queijo</a></h2>
        <p>Went to Brazil in June with some friends and these were one of my favorite things I ate there! 
This was a first attempt to replace the frozen food aisle variety from Trader Joeâ€™s. 
Not the prettiest bread I have ever seen but I thought the <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-po-de-queijo-brazilian-cheese-bread-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-176118">cheese bread</a> ended up turning out pretty well!</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve always been a big fan of all things eggs-related and this potato and onion omelette might just be my favorite. 
Thanks to my roommate Alvaro for teaching me how to make this :)</p>
