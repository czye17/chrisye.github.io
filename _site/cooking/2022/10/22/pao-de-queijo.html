<p>Went to Brazil in June with some friends and these were one of my favorite things I ate there! 
This was a first attempt to replace the frozen food aisle variety from Trader Joe’s. 
Not the prettiest bread I have ever seen but I thought the <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-po-de-queijo-brazilian-cheese-bread-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-176118">cheese bread</a> ended up turning out pretty well!</p>
