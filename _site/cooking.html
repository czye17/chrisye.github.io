        <h3>29 Dec 2022 - Deep Dish Pizza</h3>
        <img src="imgs/cooking/deep_dish.png" width="50%">
        <p>While making pie last week, I decided making a deep dish pizza was the natural next step. 
(Plus, the deep dish at Regentsâ€™ Pizzeria is really something). 
When I found that Sallyâ€™s Baking Addiction had a <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-make-chicago-style-deep-dish-pizza/&quot;">recipe</a> thatâ€™s really all I needed to get started.
It wasnâ€™t the prettiest pizza, but I think it tasted decent.
I may have also pushed the limits on how deep a pizza can really get.</p>

        <h3>24 Dec 2022 - Apple Crumble Pie</h3>
        <img src="imgs/cooking/apple_crumble.png" width="50%">
        <p>Made a really tasty empanada (not picture) dinner and apple crumble pie (pictured) dessert for Christmas Eve dinner with Zac.
Followed this one up with a santa hat jog the next morning ðŸŽ„</p>

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h3>19 Dec 2022 - Vegetarian Ramen</h3>
        <img src="imgs/cooking/ramen.png" width="50%">
        <p>Had to make some ramen so I can show off the nice bowl I bought during Thanksgiving. 
As usual, the soft-boiled marinated eggs were the best part. ðŸ¥š</p>

    </li>

        <h3>24 Nov 2022 - Thanksgiving</h3>
        <img src="imgs/cooking/thanksgiving.png" width="50%">
        <p>A great trip back east to see Kasey and Lydia! 
An amazing thanksgiving dinner to start an awesome weekend ðŸ˜Š</p>

    </li>

        <h3>19 Nov 2022 - Pisto</h3>
        <img src="imgs/cooking/pisto.png" width="50%">
        <p>Thank you again to Alvaro for adding another great recipe to my list! 
I make this almost every week nowâ€¦</p>

    </li>

        <h3>07 Nov 2022 - Butternut Squash Soup</h3>
        <img src="imgs/cooking/butternut_squash.png" width="50%">
        <p>Made this a couple weeks before at my friendâ€™s place and really loved how warm and soothing the soup was. 
I also wanted to try my hand at making homemade bread so I thought the two would go together pretty well. 
Really enjoyed this <a href="https://www.isabeleats.com/roasted-butternut-squash-soup-with-toasted-pumpkin-seeds/">recipe</a> and another plus is that one butternut squash makes quite a bit of soup.</p>

        <h3>26 Oct 2022 - Salmon Asparagus</h3>
        <img src="imgs/cooking/salmon_asparagus.png" width="50%">
        

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h3>22 Oct 2022 - Pao De Queijo</h3>
        <img src="imgs/cooking/pao_queijo.png" width="50%">
        <p>Went to Brazil in June with some friends and these were one of my favorite things I ate there! 
This was a first attempt to replace the frozen food aisle variety from Trader Joeâ€™s. 
Not the prettiest bread I have ever seen but I thought the <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-po-de-queijo-brazilian-cheese-bread-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-176118">cheese bread</a> ended up turning out pretty well!</p>

    <li>
        <h3>08 Oct 2022 - Spanish Omelette</h3>
        <img src="imgs/cooking/spanish_omelette.png" width="50%">
        <p>Iâ€™ve always been a big fan of all things eggs-related and this potato and onion omelette might just be my favorite. 
Thanks to my roommate Alvaro for teaching me how to make this :)</p>
