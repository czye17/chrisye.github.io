            <h1>about me</h1>
            <p>Hi ðŸŒŠ! I'm a first-year PhD student in UC San Diego's CS Theory Group where I am very lucky to work with <a
                    href="https://barnasaha.net">Barna Saha</a> and <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/">Russell
                    Impagliazzo</a>. I am interested in algorithm design, fine-grained complexity, as well as
                computational complexity and learning theory. 
            </p>

        Previously, I worked for a year as a Quantitative Analyst in the Fixed Income, Secured Lending Group at Morgan Stanley.
        Before that, I received my undegraduate degree in mathematics from Princeton in 2021, where I was fortunate to
        work with <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/gkol">Gillat Kol</a>. I also completed an internship with the AI Infrastructure Group at <a href="https://www.aidoc.com">aidoc</a> during the summer of 2019.
    </p>
    <p>When not at the office, I enjoy running, biking, soccer, and volleyball. I also like to <a
            href="/cooking.html">cook and bake</a> in my spare time (feel free to send your favorite recipes my way!).
    </p>
    <p>You can reach me at czye (at) ucsd (dot) edu</p>
    <p>Thank you to <a href="https://sxzhang25.github.io">Sharon</a> for giving me the template to her personal website.</p>
